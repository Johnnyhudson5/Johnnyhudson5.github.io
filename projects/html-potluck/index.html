        <h1>Fluffy Diner Pancakes</h1>
        <p>Prep Time: 1 hour 30 minutes</p>
        <p>Cook Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>Total Time: 2 hours</p>
        <p>Yields: 3 large pancakes</p>
        <p>
            These pancakes are a copycat of the viral ones from Middle Child in 
            Philly, where the secret is yeast, giving them that perfectly airy,
            fluffy texture you can’t get from regular pancakes. They’re blowing 
            up on TikTok, but if you’ve ever tried to get them at either Middle 
            Child or Golden Diner in NYC, you know the lines are insane. Forget 
            the wait and the travel—these golden, melt-in-your-mouth pancakes 
            can be made right at home, anytime!

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the whole milk, buttermilk, 
                flour, instant yeast, and sugar. Let it bloom in a warm place 
                for 1 hour until bubbly and airy.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the yeast is blooming, make the honey butter maple sauce: 
                over medium-low heat, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Then
                stir in the honey, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt until smooth
                and glossy. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla 
                extract until smooth and well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the batter has bloomed, add the whisked wet ingredients to 
                it and mix until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                In another bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, 
                baking soda, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the dry mix to the batter and whisk gently just until no 
                more dry bits remain. Do not overmix—the batter should be thick 
                and a little lumpy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400°F. Onee preheated, add your skillet 
                inside and let it preheat for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully remove the hot skillet, grease it with a bit of oil, 
                then pour in about 1¼ to 1½ cups of batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the pancake is puffed up and 
                golden on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip over on a plate, add a slice of butter, and drizzle with 
                the warm honey butter maple sauce to cover the entire surface. 
                Enjoy warm.
            </li>
