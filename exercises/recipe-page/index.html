            Think garlic bread, but way more fun. This hasselback grilled 
            cheese has more surface area for that garlicky butter to soak
            in and get extra crispy, with melty cheese hiding in the 
            iddle. Rip off little squares as you eat and enjoy a cheese
            pull with every bite.

        <h1>Hasselback Garlic Bread Grilled Cheese</h1>
        <p>
            This isn’t your basic grilled cheese. We’re taking 
            it up a notch with garlic butter, crispy golden edges, and melty 
            cheese in every bite. But the best part? The top slice gets the 
            Hasselback treatment, which means more square footage for crispiness
            and cheesy goodness. Each little cut toasts up perfectly so you 
            can rip off crispy, buttery squares as you go — it’s grilled cheese
            like you’ve never had before.
